                <h3>Intro
                </h3>
                <p> This project was made in the course Tangible and
                  Embodied Interaction within the field of Smart homes. The
                  aim for this project was to identify a problem related to
                  automation in the home and to build a prototype with
                  tangible interactions that would help solve this problem.
                  We started off by focusing on the issues existing with home
                  security but ended up working on a reminder by the door to prevent the user forget their devices left on. Throughout the
                  progress we had the interaction with a smart handle in mind
                  and the functions it could provide but changed the concept
                  around a few times. In the end we have created a new way
                  of interacting with the door handle.
                </p>
                <img class="background__image" src="/images/malmouniversity.png" />

                <h3>Concept
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The concept consisted of a screen connected to all smart applications in a user's home, as well as a special door handle. When the
                  door handle was interacted with in a special way, the screen would display all connected smart devices that were not turned off,
                  and the user could control them from the screen on the door.
                  <br/>
                  For the purpose of the project, we instead created a physical prototype that sounded an alarm from the forgotten devices.
                </p>
                <h3> Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Starting the project we created mind maps of the different
                  ideas for where we could place different smart devices, and
                  how these could be used. As well as doing research for
                  existing products and how they are implemented in the
                  homes of the user. By placing ourselves in a home and
                  discussing what would be needed in each room, we could
                  conclude what we wanted to work with - home security.
                  This decision was based on our research where we found
                  that there is a concern about having technology running an
                  entire house.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We ended up creating a new interaction with the door
                  handle. The act of pulling the handle upwards would start a
                  scan of the home, and any connected devices that were still
                  left on would be shown on a display next to the door.
                  Placing the display in the user's peripheral view the aspect
                  of glanceability would be enhanced
                </p>
                <p>
                  To produce and develop our prototype we did research on
                  which Arduino components to use and how those different
                  components work, as well as which one suited our
                  imagined prototype the best. We determined that the
                  connection between the door handle and the coffee maker
                  should be wireless and after researching wireless
                  components the decision to use a 433 MHz radio
                  transmitter and receiver with a range of up to seven meters.
                </p>
                  With these components we were able to clearly
                  show the intended functionality.

                <p>
                  We created the following video prototype to showcase the design.

                  During the course Tangible and embodied interaction, we had small projects were we created physical prototypes that include electronics
                  and sensors. The goal of this project was to design a tangible interaction solution for an IOT enabled smart lamp and the
                  design solution should address a specific domestic practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lights was a project that focused on designing with tangiability, and during it we came up with a concept for a hub that controls
                  the user's home lighting, together with a companion application that lets the user remotely turn the lights off.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The functionalities we have design are a multifunctional device which is placed in the hallway, this connects all of your chosen lamps and bulbs.
                  Which in turn can be connected your choice of smart devices. You can connect all of the members in the family to the hub and a notification will be
                  sent if the last person to leave have left all or some of the light on. This message will only be sent to that specific person. The GPS function in
                   your smart device will calculate when your step out of the designated area around your home and only then send the notification.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   The tangible aspects we have used is a hub, where you can connect your smart phone or other
                  device. On both of these devices you can change the light setting around your house and also
                  which lights you want control from time to time. Although main aspect is the notification when you
                  have left your on at home, and left the selected radius of your home.
                  </p>
                <p>
                  We created the following video prototype to showcase the design.

                    During the Visual Communications course we got an assignment to create an App that used
                    wearable technologies.
                    <br>
                    I decided to create a concept that took all of a user's membership cards
                    and stored them all in one place, easily accessible through the user's phone.
                    This allows for the user to not worry about carrying around all of their cards
                    in their wallet, since most of them are commonly not used every day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first step was to create the concept and to sketch it out. After that, I created a storyboard
                    to display the flow of the application, and what the thought area of use is.
                    The last step of this project was to create interface mock-ups with Illustrator and Photoshop.

          I'm a 25 year old interaction student att Malmö Högskola. I was born in the medium sized city of Lund, in Skåne.
          For the first years of my life I lived in Veberöd, and after High School I spent a few years travelling the world.
          I'm now an Interaction Designer student at Malmö Högskola, studying my second year. In this portfolio I have collected
          some of the projects that I have been working on during my studies.
