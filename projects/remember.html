        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p> This project was made in the course Tangible and Embodied Interaction within the field of Smart homes. The aim for
          this project was to identify a problem related to automation in the home and to build a prototype with tangible
          interactions that would help solve this problem. We started off by focusing on the issues existing with home security
          but ended up working on a reminder by the door to prevent the user forget their devices left on. Throughout the
          progress we had the interaction with a smart handle in mind and the functions it could provide but changed the
          concept around a few times. In the end we have created a new way of interacting with the door handle.

        <h3>Concept
        </h3>
        <p>
          The concept consisted of a screen connected to all smart applications in a user's home, as well as a special door handle.
          When the door handle was interacted with in a special way, the screen would display all connected smart devices
          that were not turned off, and the user could control them from the screen on the door.
          <br/> For the purpose of the project, we instead created a physical prototype that sounded an alarm from the forgotten
          devices.
        </p>
        <h3> Process
        </h3>
        <p>
          Starting the project we created mind maps of the different ideas for where we could place different smart devices, and how
          these could be used. As well as doing research for existing products and how they are implemented in the homes
          of the user. By placing ourselves in a home and discussing what would be needed in each room, we could conclude
          what we wanted to work with - home security. This decision was based on our research where we found that there
          is a concern about having technology running an entire house.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ended up creating a new interaction with the door handle. The act of pulling the handle upwards would start a scan of
          the home, and any connected devices that were still left on would be shown on a display next to the door. Placing
          the display in the user's peripheral view the aspect of glanceability would be enhanced
        </p>
        <p>
          To produce and develop our prototype we did research on which Arduino components to use and how those different components
          work, as well as which one suited our imagined prototype the best. We determined that the connection between the
          door handle and the coffee maker should be wireless and after researching wireless components the decision to use
          a 433 MHz radio transmitter and receiver with a range of up to seven meters.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these components we were able to clearly show the intended functionality.

          We created the following video prototype to showcase the design.
