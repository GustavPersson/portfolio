          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            Together with Jayway Malm√∂ and Uniti I am currently writing my Bachelor's thesis, focusing on how to best design glanceable
            heads up displays for modern cars.

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            I am researching how to design Heads Up Displays in cars in a way that maximizes the users' experience, by focusing on the
            glanceability and ease of use. I have created a test HUD in a VR driving simulator, based on Uniti's HUD. By
            letting users test different versions of the HUD in the simulator, I will be able to determine how user friendly
            a car interface based on glanceability is.
          </p>

          <p>
            The actual VR simulator is developed by two other thesis workers at Jayway, and I've modified the program in order to add
            a HUD, which accurately simulates the sense of depth and space that the Uniti glanceable hud is based on. The
            big difference between a classical dashboard and the HUD is that HUD elements are always in the drivers field
            of vision, which is supposed to allow for a quicker, more glanceable, interaction when the driver needs information.
            For example, the battery meter and the speedometer are located to the side of the windshield, with a sense of
            depth that makes it seem like they are floating a few meters in front of the car, while navigation is overlaid
            onto the road.
          </p>

            The thesis will be complete by May 2018.
