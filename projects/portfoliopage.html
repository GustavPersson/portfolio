          <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
          <p>I have worked with keeping a balance in the design. I consistently use the same font family and colors, and the sizes are proportionally scaled against each other. I used colors for my font and background that are in balance with each other, light colors so that there’s not too big contrasts.

          All images are to scale and proportionate to each other, and scale to keep proportions even if viewed on a smaller screen.</p>

          <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
          <p>I chose to use a simple hierarchy. I put the projects at the top, because they are the most important part of the portfolio. In the project slider, I put the most important projects at the start, to highlight them.</p>

          <h3>Colour</h3>
          <p>I’ve used colors that I think are in harmony with each other. My background and font color are not bright colors, because I want the project images to break through and catch the user’s interest. I’ve used brightly colored placeholder images to illustrate this.</p>

          <h3>Typography</h3>
          <p>I chose the font because I thought it was clear and easy to read, and I’ve used a grid system on my text areas to keep the text contained, so that the lines don’t grow too long.</p>
