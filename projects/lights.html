        <h3>Intro
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the course Tangible and embodied interaction, we had small projects were we created physical prototypes that include
          electronics and sensors. The goal of this project was to design a tangible interaction solution for an IOT enabled
          smart lamp and the design solution should address a specific domestic practice.
        </p>
        <h3>Concept
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lights was a project that focused on designing with tangiability, and during it we came up with a concept for a hub that
          controls the user's home lighting, together with a companion application that lets the user remotely turn the lights
          off.
        </p>
        <h3>Process
        </h3>
        <p>
          The functionalities we have design are a multifunctional device which is placed in the hallway, this connects all of your
          chosen lamps and bulbs. Which in turn can be connected your choice of smart devices. You can connect all of the
          members in the family to the hub and a notification will be sent if the last person to leave have left all or some
          of the light on. This message will only be sent to that specific person. The GPS function in your smart device
          will calculate when your step out of the designated area around your home and only then send the notification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tangible aspects we have used is a hub, where you can connect your smart phone or other device. On both of these devices
          you can change the light setting around your house and also which lights you want control from time to time. Although
          main aspect is the notification when you have left your on at home, and left the selected radius of your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created the following video prototype to showcase the design.
