          <h3>Intro
          </h3>
          <p>
            During the Visual Communications course we got an assignment to create an App that used wearable technologies. The task were
            to choose an existing wearable technology and conceptualize a practical application for it.
          </p>


          <h3>Concept
          </h3>
          <p>
            I decided to create a concept that took all of a user's membership cards and stored them all in one place, easily accessible
            through the user's phone. This allows for the user to not worry about carrying around all of their cards in their
            wallet, since most of them are commonly not used every day.
          </p>
          <h3>Process
          </h3>
          <p>
            The first step was to create the concept and to sketch it out. I used sketching and storyboarding as tools to design and
            communicate my concept in a clear way while leaving room for further iteration. After that, I created a storyboard
            with Adobe Photoshop to display the flow of the application, and what the thought area of use is. The last step
            of this project was to create interface mock-ups with Adobe Illustrator.
